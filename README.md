# team-profile-generator

## Description
This application is designed to be a team profile generator using the node command in the user's terminal. Once initialized the user will be given a set of questions that they will have to answer about their team members. This information will then be generated dynamically onto a new HTML page that displays the team members. The team profile generator utilized tests within JavaScript to ensure that the applicatio runs smoothly.  

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "team-profile-generator" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
You may use this to make an HTML page that dynamically updates based on the information entered in the terminal. YOU MUST RUN THE NODE INDEX.JS COMMAND IN YOUR TERMINAL FOR THIS TO WORK.
